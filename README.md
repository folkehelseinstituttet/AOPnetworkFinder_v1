Figure 1 Graphic mark of "AOP_networkFinder. The green colour represent Molecular Initiating Event (MIE), Orange represents Key Event (KE) where two joint key events are leading to Adverse Outcome (AO) marked with red colour. Blue circles represents known genes that affect one of the KE. Notice that this representation is in form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with no directed cycles.

Finds the status of all AOPs in the webpage AOPWiki.org/aops (OECD Status)

Figure 2  Representation of qAOP thinking in probabilistic way. A hypothetical AOP is given where MIE is followed by two key events that let to adverse outcome, in this case dead of rats. The activation of the MIA is done by stressor (here a group of chemicals). For each of KEs assay was constructed and data is available. Each of the key events contains information from multiple experiment about dose response curve from every of the experiments for the activation of the KE. Given the probability of activation of KEs one can calculate the joint probability of activation of events to calculate the probability of activation of Adverse Outcome (AO). What remains in this concept is also translation from such models to human Figure created by MW and NY using Biorender
